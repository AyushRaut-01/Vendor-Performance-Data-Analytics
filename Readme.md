# Vendor Performance Data Analytics

## Project Overview

The **Vendor Performance Data Analytics** project focuses on evaluating and analyzing vendor performance metrics to support data-driven decision-making in vendor management. By assessing key performance indicators (KPIs), this project aims to identify areas for improvement, optimize vendor relationships, and enhance overall supply chain efficiency.

## Technologies Used

* **Python**: For data processing and analysis.
* **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive data exploration and visualization.
* **SQL**: For database interactions and querying.
* **Power BI**: For creating interactive dashboards and reports.

##  Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

* Python 3.x
* Jupyter Notebook
* Required Python libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AyushRaut-01/Vendor-Performance-Data-Analytics.git
   cd Vendor-Performance-Data-Analytics
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. Open `Vendor Performance Analysis.ipynb` to begin your analysis.

## Dashboard

An interactive dashboard has been created using Power BI to visualize vendor performance metrics.

## Analysis Objectives

* Evaluate delivery performance and distribution (on-time vs. early deliveries).
* Analyze total freight costs over multiple years.
* Assess product quality trends and rejection rates.
* Identify potential correlations between vendor performance and associated costs.
* Provide actionable recommendations for enhancing vendor performance and optimizing costs.
* Improve overall product quality through vendor collaboration and negotiation.

## Business Value

This project offers several benefits:

* **Enhanced Delivery Performance**: By analyzing delivery performance and identifying trends, the project aims to improve on-time delivery rates, reduce lead times, and enhance customer satisfaction.
* **Cost Optimization**: The project will identify opportunities for cost savings through strategic vendor negotiations, exploring vendors with on-time deliveries and higher ship base costs, and streamlining supply chain processes.
* **Improved Product Quality**: Through continuous quality monitoring and collaboration with vendors experiencing higher reject percentages, the project aims to address quality issues and improve product quality across operations.
* **Data-Driven Decision-Making**: The analysis findings and recommendations will provide valuable insights to the Operations department and executive team, enabling them to make informed decisions for vendor management and operational optimization.
